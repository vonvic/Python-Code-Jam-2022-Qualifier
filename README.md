# Python-Code-Jam-2022-Qualifier
My solution for the Python Codejam 2022 Qualifier. The task was to implement a
restaurant manager by implementing the `__call__` method of the
`RestaurantManager` class located in `qualifier.py`. All the tests in `test.py`
were provided by Python Discord Group. The official qualifer can be found
on their [Github](https://github.com/python-discord/code-jam-qualifier-9/).

## Requirements
```
Python 3.10.0
```

## How To Run
You must change current directory to the `qualifier` directory. You can do so
in this command (assuming you are currently in the project directory).
```
cd qualifier
```
Then run:
```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.py
```
